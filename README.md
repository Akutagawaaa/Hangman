# Hangman
Hangman game using Python

This is a word guessing game, where a word is selected randomly from the dataset and you have to guess the word correctly to avoid the hanging of the man. If you lose all the chances of your guesses, the man will be hanged and you will lose the game.

There are three categories of the characters out of which the word will be taken out randomly, DC characters, Marvel characters, and Anime characters.
